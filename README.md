## Engines

the blog and training sections of the site are built with [rails engines](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html). Each engine has it's own dummy rails environment(under `spec/dummy`) used for testing each engine in isolation.

### Engine Migrations

Migrations are created within each engine using namespaced tables, so a `user` table within the training_app engine would be named `training_app_users`.

To create a migration:

```sh
cd engines/<ENGINE NAME>/
rails g migration add_some_column_to_some_table
```

Running `rake db:migrate` from within the engines directory will apply migrations to the dummy database. Running `rake db:migrate` from root directory will apply migrations (including any engine migrations) to the gaslight database.

### Engine Tests

Each engine maintains it's own test suite. The dummy environment is used when testing each engine.

To run an engines tests:

```sh
cd engines/<ENGINE NAME>/
rspec
```

To run an engine in isolation:

```sh
cd engines/<ENGINE NAME>/spec/dummy
rails s
```
